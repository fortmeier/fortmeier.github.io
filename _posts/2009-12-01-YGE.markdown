The first module of my Masters studies consisted of the implementation of a game engine and the application of it.

This I solved by combining OpenGL, the physics engine ODE and OpenAL into a single framework. To demonstrate the capabilities of the engine, I used it to create a gyrocopter flying simulator.

It featured:

* Multiple levels
* Realistic physics
* A developer console
