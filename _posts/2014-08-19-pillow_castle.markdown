We made an awesome game at Innogame's 2014 Gamejam at Gamescom. Here are some pictures:

It is implemented in Java, using the libraries libgdx and artemis.

You can find a download link at [Innogame's blogpost](http://www.innogames.com/de/blog/2014/08/games-jam/#) or download an updated version [here](http://keksdev.de/v42.jar). For the best gameplay, you need two X-box controllers. Alternatively, it is possible to play the game with the keyboard with the following keys:

### Player 1
* move around with WASD
* shoot with E
* pickup/place parts with Q

### Player 2
* move around with JKLI
* shoot with O
* pickup/place parts with U

It's already fun to play, but there are still some issues with the game. Hopefully, we will update it with improved graphics and gameplay in the future.
