Inspired by games like Freelancer, this project aimed at the creation of my own space simualation. Maybe my artistically most advanced one ...

For the skymap, the method used in Homeworld and Homeworld 2 was copied. Instead of using a cubemap or similar, the skymap consisted of vertices with vertex colors. I used a script for triangulization of a 2D image painted with gimp and then used Blender to create a sphere from the resulting mesh.
