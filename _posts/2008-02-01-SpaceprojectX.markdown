A very fun project.  Interesting aspect: For the skymap, the method used in Homeworld and Homeworld 2 was copied. Instead of using a cubemap or similar, the skymap consisted of vertices with vertex colors. I used a script [1] for triangulization of a 2D image painted with gimp and then used Blender to create a sphere frm the resulting mesh.


[1] Paper with the procedure.

[2] New article which explains the method, was not available back then.
