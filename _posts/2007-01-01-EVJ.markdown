An early detour from my focus on virtual reality and an early use of Ruby on Rails.

Together with my friend [Lennart](http://works.lmaa.name/), we coded the custom content managment system "Sir Veillance" and used it to create a website of the EVJ Sch√∂ppenstedt. After being used for several years, it now has been replaced by TYPO3 by the webmaster.
