In this team project, I led a team of five students (including me) to research, implement and document a software prototype of a "Virtual Museum".

Based on face tracking using OpenCV and a single webcam, the viewpoint of a user standing in front of a display is estimated. On the display, a virtual exhibition scene is rendered. The virtual camera position into the scene was adjusted based on the viewpoint of the user, giving the impression as if the screen would be a window into the exhibition room.
