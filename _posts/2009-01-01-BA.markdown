For my Bachelor's thesis, I implemented and researched a tracking algorithm for augmented reality based on a particle filter. 

This project included:

* Camera calibration
* A pattern tracking algorithm to initize the tracking of a camera pose using fiducial markers
* A tracking algorithm that uses a particle filter to track the camera pose based on distict landmarks
* Methods for estimation of new distinct landmarks
