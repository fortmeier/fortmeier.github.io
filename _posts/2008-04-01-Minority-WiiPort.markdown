During my Bachelor studies, I participated in a team assignement in which we had to implement a novell interaction interface. Using infrad LEDs attached to a glove and tracking by using an Nintendo Wiimote, the user was able to interact with our photo collection software.

The team project included everything including project planning, implementation and documentation.
